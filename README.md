My favorite sandwich is "Chicken & Mayo Sandwich"

> ## Excercise (Week 6)
> ### 3 Confusing Things:
> 1. The whole concept of merging and commit is still a bit overwhelming.
> 2. Does the action of adding another primitive within an existing array set via "push" also work for "const." variable??
> 3. How can one go back a version if they have accidentally merged their new commit.
> ### 3 Things I have a solid understanding about:
> 1. How to use the terminal to view files.
> 2. Using the "let" and "const" variable.
> 3. The concept of boolean kinda intimidating, but I think I have a pretty good understanding now.
> ### Analogy I use in class:
> 1. I think about a video I saw in regards to a genie granting a wish. In that unless you are extremely literal, you'll end up getting an entirely different wish granted to you. So I always think about being absolute literal when coding.
