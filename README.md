> ## 3-2-1 Excercise (Week 3)
> ### "Aha": Moments:
> 1. Understood what the git commands do, eg.: "git clone", "git add", etc.
> 2. Using Console.log to show data inside a file
> 3. Clear understanding of the difference between a string, number and boolean.
> ### Things that are still unclear:
> 1. Couldn't do the pull or push cause I was using the school computer, though hopefully I shouldn't face the issue, if I do I'll refer to the solutions that others have provided
> 2. Other than the above I have pretty much understood all of it.
> ### Word for how you're feeling:
> 1. Looking forward to the next class. "Excited"
